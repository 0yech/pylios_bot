# pylios_bot (DEPRECATED)
Elsword Europe's official bot used for Mr.Mrs Elios contests.
Mr.Mrs Elios events were contests where players were given a theme and had to come up with an outfit accordingly. Members of Elsword's staff would then be the judges

/!\ this project shouldn't be used without any major modifications.

Current issues -

- Too many users applying at once may cause a crash.
- Bot allows slash commands but in a now very old and outdated way.
